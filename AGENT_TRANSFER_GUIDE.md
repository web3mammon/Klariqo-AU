# 👥 Agent Transfer Implementation Guide

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

Agent transfer functionality has been successfully implemented for both inbound and outbound calls, allowing customers to request human assistance during AI conversations.

## 🔄 **How Agent Transfer Works**

### **Scenario 1: Twilio Number → AI → Agent Transfer (RECOMMENDED ✅)**
```
Customer calls Twilio number → AI handles conversation → Customer says "speak to agent" → Transfer to client's number
```
**This is the recommended approach and works perfectly!**

### **Scenario 2: Forwarded Setup → Agent Transfer (NOT RECOMMENDED ❌)**
```
Customer calls Twilio number → Immediately forwarded to client's number → No AI interaction possible
```
**This doesn't work because there's no AI conversation to transfer from.**

## 🔧 Configuration

### Location: `config.py`

```python
# ============================================================================
# 👥 AGENT TRANSFER CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
AGENT_TRANSFER = {
    "enabled": True,                              # Set to True to enable agent transfer
    "agent_number": "+61412345678",               # Number to transfer to (same as forward_to_number usually)
    "transfer_message": "I'll transfer you to our team now. Please hold.",  # Message before transfer
    "transfer_timeout": 30,                       # Timeout in seconds for transfer
    "transfer_keywords": [                        # Keywords that trigger transfer
        "speak to agent", "human", "real person", "transfer", 
        "speak to someone", "talk to someone", "agent", "representative"
    ],
    "auto_transfer_conditions": [                 # Conditions for automatic transfer
        "emergency", "urgent", "complaint", "escalate"
    ]
}
```

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Customer Conversation Flow:**
1. **Customer calls** Twilio number
2. **AI (Jason) greets** and handles initial conversation
3. **Customer can:**
   - Continue talking to AI for help
   - Say transfer keywords (e.g., "speak to agent")
   - Mention urgent issues (auto-transfer)
4. **AI transfers** call to human agent
5. **Human agent** receives call with context

### **Transfer Triggers:**
- **Manual Transfer**: Customer says "speak to agent", "human", "real person", etc.
- **Auto Transfer**: Customer mentions "emergency", "urgent", "complaint", etc.

## 📁 **Files Modified**

1. **`config.py`** - Added AGENT_TRANSFER configuration
2. **`router.py`** - Added `_handle_agent_transfer()` method
3. **`routes/inbound.py`** - Added transfer logic to conversation handler
4. **`routes/outbound.py`** - Added transfer logic to outbound handler
5. **`routes/test.py`** - Added `/debug/agent_transfer` test endpoint

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Quick Test**
```bash
# Test configuration
py -c "from config import Config; print('Agent transfer enabled:', Config.AGENT_TRANSFER['enabled'])"

# Start server and visit test page
py main.py
# Then visit: http://localhost:5000/test
# Click: "Agent Transfer Status"
```

### **Web Interface**
- Visit: `http://localhost:5000/test`
- Click: "Agent Transfer Status"
- Shows current configuration and test scenarios

## 🔄 **Client Setup Options**

### **Option 1: AI + Transfer (RECOMMENDED)**
```python
# In config.py
CALL_FORWARDING = {
    "enabled": False,  # AI handles all calls
}

AGENT_TRANSFER = {
    "enabled": True,   # Allow transfers to human
    "agent_number": "+61412345678",  # Client's number
}
```

**Flow:** Customer → AI → Transfer to Human (when requested)

### **Option 2: Pure Forwarding**
```python
# In config.py
CALL_FORWARDING = {
    "enabled": True,   # All calls forwarded immediately
    "forward_to_number": "+61412345678",
}

AGENT_TRANSFER = {
    "enabled": False,  # No AI conversation possible
}
```

**Flow:** Customer → Direct to Human (no AI)

### **Option 3: AI Only**
```python
# In config.py
CALL_FORWARDING = {
    "enabled": False,  # AI handles all calls
}

AGENT_TRANSFER = {
    "enabled": False,  # No transfers allowed
}
```

**Flow:** Customer → AI Only (no human transfer)

## 📞 **Real-World Examples**

### **Plumbing Business (AI + Transfer)**
```
Customer: "Hi, I have a blocked drain"
AI: "Hi! I'm Jason from Pete's Plumbing. I can help with that."
Customer: "Actually, I'd like to speak to a human"
AI: "Of course! I'll transfer you to our team now. Please hold."
[Transfer to +61412345678]
```

### **Restaurant (Pure Forwarding)**
```
Customer: "Hi, I'd like to make a reservation"
[Immediate transfer to +61487654321]
```

### **Medical Practice (AI + Auto-Transfer)**
```
Customer: "Hi, I have an emergency"
AI: "That sounds urgent! I'll transfer you to our emergency line immediately."
[Auto-transfer to +61411223344]
```

## 🎯 **Client Adaptation Strategy**

### **For New Clients, Ask:**

1. **"Do you want AI to handle calls first?"**
   - **Yes** → Set `CALL_FORWARDING["enabled"] = False`
   - **No** → Set `CALL_FORWARDING["enabled"] = True`

2. **"Do you want customers to be able to transfer to a human?"**
   - **Yes** → Set `AGENT_TRANSFER["enabled"] = True`
   - **No** → Set `AGENT_TRANSFER["enabled"] = False`

3. **"What's your phone number for transfers?"**
   - Set `AGENT_TRANSFER["agent_number"] = "+614XXXXXXXX"`

### **Recommended Configurations by Business Type:**

**Small Business (AI + Transfer)**
```python
CALL_FORWARDING = {"enabled": False}
AGENT_TRANSFER = {"enabled": True, "agent_number": "+614XXXXXXXX"}
```

**High-Volume Business (Pure Forwarding)**
```python
CALL_FORWARDING = {"enabled": True, "forward_to_number": "+614XXXXXXXX"}
AGENT_TRANSFER = {"enabled": False}
```

**Emergency Services (AI + Auto-Transfer)**
```python
CALL_FORWARDING = {"enabled": False}
AGENT_TRANSFER = {
    "enabled": True, 
    "agent_number": "+614XXXXXXXX",
    "auto_transfer_conditions": ["emergency", "urgent", "critical"]
}
```

## ✅ **Implementation Status**

- ✅ **Agent transfer detection** - Complete
- ✅ **Transfer keywords** - Configurable
- ✅ **Auto-transfer conditions** - Configurable
- ✅ **TwiML generation** - Complete
- ✅ **Inbound/Outbound support** - Complete
- ✅ **Test endpoints** - Complete
- ✅ **Documentation** - Complete

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Test with real calls** - Verify transfer works end-to-end
2. **Client onboarding** - Use this for clients who want AI + human option
3. **Customize keywords** - Adjust transfer triggers per client needs
4. **Monitor transfers** - Track how often transfers are requested

## 🔄 **Answer to Your Question**

**"Can we do transfer in the same number flow?"**

- **If client uses Twilio number for incoming calls**: ✅ **YES** - Perfect for AI + transfer
- **If client forwards all calls immediately**: ❌ **NO** - No AI conversation to transfer from

**Recommendation**: Use Twilio number for incoming calls, then transfer to client's existing number when needed. This gives you the best of both worlds!
