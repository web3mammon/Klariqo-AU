## ❓ **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **"Will this change how I use my calendar?"**
**No!** You keep using your calendar exactly as you do now. The AI just reads from and writes to your calendar automatically.

### **"What happens to my existing appointments?"**
**Nothing!** All your existing appointments stay exactly where they are. The AI only adds new appointments when customers book.

### **"Do I need to learn anything new?"**
**No!** Keep using your calendar normally. Block out unavailable times as usual. Everything works the same.

### **"What if the AI makes a mistake?"**
The AI is very careful, but if there's ever an issue:
- You can delete any appointments the AI created
- You can block out times to prevent bookings
- The system has safety checks to prevent double bookings

### **"Will customers see my calendar?"**
**No!** Customers only see available time slots. They never see your actual calendar or other appointments.

### **"What if I don't want to use this anymore?"**
You can stop anytime by:
- Removing the AI's access to your calendar
- Or just telling us to turn it off
