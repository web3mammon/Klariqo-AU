```

---

## üéµ **PHASE 2: Audio Content Adaptation (2-3 hours)**

### **Step 1: Industry Analysis & Content Planning**

**For AU/NZ Hotels (Melbourne Grand, Auckland City Hotel, etc.):**
```bash
# Common inquiries to cover:
# - Room availability & seasonal rates
# - Check-in/check-out times (local time zones)
# - Amenities (pool, gym, restaurant, wifi)
# - Location & directions (CBD, airport transfers)
# - Booking modifications & cancellations
# - Special services (concierge, room service, laundry)
# - Event hosting & conference facilities
# - Local attractions & tours

# Session variables to track:
# - check_in_date, check_out_date, duration
# - room_type, guest_count, bed_preference
# - special_requests, budget_range
# - arrival_method (flight, car, train)
# - purpose (business, leisure, event)
```

**For AU/NZ Real Estate (Brisbane Property Group, Auckland Realty, etc.):**
```bash
# Common inquiries to cover:
# - Property availability & listings
# - Inspection bookings & open homes
# - Price guides & market reports
# - Suburb information & schools
# - Financing & mortgage pre-approval
# - Property management services
# - Investment opportunities
# - Settlement & legal processes

# Session variables to track:
# - property_type, location_preference, budget_range
# - buyer_type (first_home, investor, upgrader)
# - inspection_availability, contact_method
# - financing_status, timeline
# - specific_requirements (bedrooms, garage, etc.)
```

**For AU/NZ Medical Centers:**
```bash
# Common inquiries to cover:
# - Doctor availability & bulk billing
# - Appointment bookings & cancellations
# - Medicare & health fund billing
# - Prescription renewals
# - Test results & pathology
# - Specialist referrals

# - After-hours & emergency contacts

# Session variables to track:
# - patient_name, medicare_number
# - doctor_preference, appointment_type
# - health_fund, urgency_level
# - preferred_time, contact_method
```

### **Step 2: Create New Audio Content**

#### **Update Excel Management File**
```bash
# 1. Open audio_files.xlsx
# 2. Replace ALL content with new industry-specific responses
# 3. Structure by categories relevant to AU/NZ client:

# Example for Melbourne Hotel:
Category | Filename | Transcript | Alternate_Version
---------|----------|------------|------------------
introductions | melbourne_hotel_intro.mp3 | "G'day! Welcome to [HOTEL NAME] Melbourne..." | hotel_intro_formal.mp3
room_inquiries | room_availability_au.mp3 | "I can check our availability for you..." | room_check_alt.mp3
amenities | amenities_melbourne.mp3 | "Our hotel features a rooftop pool, gym..." | amenities_detailed.mp3
booking | booking_process_au.mp3 | "I can help you book directly..." | booking_simple.mp3
local_info | melbourne_attractions.mp3 | "Melbourne's famous for its laneways..." | cbd_info.mp3
```

#### **Record New Audio Files**
```bash
# 1. Script writing for AU/NZ market:
#    - Use Australian/NZ accent and terminology
#    - Professional, friendly, helpful tone
#    - Include local references (CBD, suburbs, etc.)
#    - Use familiar terms (lift vs elevator, car park vs parking lot)

# 2. Recording requirements:
#    - Professional voice actor with AU/NZ accent
#    - Clear recording quality (no background noise)
#    - Format: MP3, high quality (44.1kHz recommended)
#    - Length: 10-45 seconds per response
#    - Natural speech pace, easy to understand

# 3. File naming convention:
#    - location_industry_topic.mp3 (e.g., melbourne_hotel_checkin.mp3)
#    - Keep filenames descriptive but concise
#    - No spaces, use underscores
#    - Include city/region if relevant
```

### **Step 3: Audio File Processing**
```bash
# 1. Place new MP3 files in audio_optimised/ directory
# 2. Update Excel file with all new content
# 3. Convert Excel to JSON:
py excel_to_json.py
# Select option 1 to convert

# 4. Convert MP3 to Œº-law format for Twilio:
py audio-optimiser.py
# This creates audio_ulaw/ directory with Twilio-ready files

# 5. Verify conversion:
ls audio_ulaw/  # Should show all your new .ulaw files
# Each .ulaw file is ~50% smaller than equivalent PCM
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL STEP: Update Route Files (OFTEN MISSED!)**
```bash
# üö® IMPORTANT: After changing audio files, you MUST update the intro files in routes

# 6. Update inbound call intro:
# File: routes/inbound.py
# Find line: selected_intro = "old_intro_file.mp3"
# Change to: selected_intro = "your_new_intro_file.mp3"

# Example for Pete's Plumbing:
# OLD: selected_intro = "school_intro.mp3"
# NEW: selected_intro = "plumbing_intro.mp3"

# Example for Melbourne Hotel:
# OLD: selected_intro = "school_intro.mp3"  
# NEW: selected_intro = "melbourne_hotel_intro.mp3"

# 7. Update outbound call intro (if using outbound calls):
# File: routes/outbound.py
# Find line: selected_intro = "old_outbound_intro.mp3"
# Change to: selected_intro = "your_new_intro_file.mp3"

# üîß Why this matters:
# - The route files tell the system which audio file to play first
# - If you don't update these, you'll get "audio not in cache" errors
# - This is the most commonly missed step when adapting for new clients
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **PHASE 3: Configuration Updates (30 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Update Session Management**
```python
# In config.py, update SESSION_FLAGS_TEMPLATE:

# For AU/NZ Hotel:
SESSION_FLAGS_TEMPLATE = {
    "intro_played": False,
    "room_inquiry_made": False,
    "amenities_discussed": False,
    "rates_mentioned": False,
    "booking_attempted": False,
    "location_discussed": False,
    "local_attractions_mentioned": False,
    "special_services_mentioned": False
}

SESSION_VARIABLES_TEMPLATE = {
    "check_in_date": None,
    "check_out_date": None,
    "room_type": None,
    "guest_count": None,
    "budget_range": None,
    "special_requests": None,
    "customer_name": None,
    "inquiry_focus": None,  # "rooms", "dining", "events", "location"
    "city_location": None,  # "melbourne", "sydney", "auckland", etc.
    "arrival_method": None  # "flight", "car", "train"
}
```

### **Step 2: Update AI Response Logic**
```python
# In router.py, update the base prompt:

# Replace generic prompts with AU/NZ industry-specific ones
# Update file selection rules for local context
# Modify conversation flow for Australian/NZ customer expectations

# Example for Melbourne hotel:
prompt = f"""You are [AI_NAME], a helpful voice assistant at [HOTEL_NAME] in Melbourne. 
Your job is to respond to guest inquiries with appropriate audio responses.

üè® MELBOURNE HOTEL RESPONSE RULES:
Guest asks about rooms ‚Üí melbourne_room_availability.mp3
Guest mentions dates ‚Üí Check season: summer_rates.mp3 or winter_rates.mp3
Guest asks amenities ‚Üí melbourne_amenities.mp3
Guest asks location ‚Üí melbourne_location_cbd.mp3
Guest wants to book ‚Üí booking_process_au.mp3
Guest asks attractions ‚Üí melbourne_attractions.mp3
..."""
```

### **Step 3: Update Voice & TTS Settings**
```python
# In config.py, update voice settings for AU/NZ:
VOICE_ID = "AU_VOICE_ID"   # ElevenLabs Australian/NZ accent voice
DEEPGRAM_LANGUAGE = "en-AU"  # Australian English (or en-NZ for New Zealand)

# In tts_engine.py, adjust voice settings for local market:
voice_settings = VoiceSettings(
    stability=0.7,           # Higher stability for professional tone
    similarity_boost=0.8,    # Good accent consistency
    style=0.2,              # Slight Australian/NZ warmth
    use_speaker_boost=True   # Essential for clear phone audio
)
```

## üß™ **PHASE 4: Testing & Validation (45 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Audio Testing**
```bash
# 1. Test audio file loading:
py main.py
# Should see: "üéµ Œº-law cache: [N] files loaded (X.XMB)"

# 2. Test individual audio files:
# Use /test endpoint to play specific files
# Verify all audio is clear with AU/NZ accent
# Check for proper pronunciation of local terms

# 3. Test audio chains:
# Ensure multiple files can play together smoothly
# Test transitions between different file types
```

### **Step 2: Conversation Flow Testing**
```bash
# Create test scenarios for AU/NZ industry:

# Melbourne Hotel Test Scenarios:
# 1. "I'm looking for a room in Melbourne CBD for next weekend"
# 2. "What facilities do you have?"  
# 3. "What are your rates for a standard room?"
# 4. "I need to change my booking"
# 5. "How do I get to your hotel from the airport?"
# 6. "What's nearby for entertainment?"

# Expected AI responses:
# - Should use Australian terminology and accent
# - Should mention Melbourne-specific amenities/locations
# - Should provide local context (CBD, transport, etc.)
# - Should guide through booking process clearly
```

### **Step 3: Twilio Integration Testing**
```bash
# Test Twilio Media Streams functionality:
# 1. Verify WebSocket connection establishes
# 2. Test Œº-law audio streaming works correctly
# 3. Check session variables are tracked correctly:
#    - Mention dates ‚Üí system should remember
#    - Ask about location ‚Üí should use remembered city
# 4. Verify no repetitive responses
# 5. Check conversation history logging
# 6. Test both inbound and outbound call flows
```
