# - Use descriptive names: "room_availability.mp3"
# - Avoid spaces: use underscores or hyphens
# - Keep names short but clear
# - Group related files: "hotel_intro.mp3", "hotel_amenities.mp3"
```

### **Step 3: Audio Content Creation**

#### **Essential Audio Files to Create:**

**For Hotels:**
```bash
# Core response files:
hotel_intro.mp3              # "Welcome to [Hotel Name], how can I help you today?"
room_availability.mp3        # "We have several room types available..."
room_rates.mp3              # "Our rates start from $XXX per night..."
check_in_times.mp3          # "Check-in is from 2 PM, check-out by 11 AM..."
amenities.mp3               # "We offer free WiFi, pool, gym, restaurant..."
location_directions.mp3     # "We're located in the CBD, 10 minutes from airport..."

# Edit audio_snippets.json to match your new audio files:
{
  "introductions": {
    "your_intro.mp3": "Your actual transcript here..."
  },
  "pricing": {
    "your_pricing.mp3": "Your actual transcript here..."
  },

```python
# Replace the base prompt with industry-specific content
prompt = f"""You are {Config.CLIENT_CONFIG['ai_assistant_name']}, a helpful voice assistant at {Config.CLIENT_CONFIG['business_name']} in {Config.CLIENT_CONFIG['city']}. 
Your job is to respond to customer inquiries with appropriate audio responses.

üè® {Config.CLIENT_CONFIG['industry'].upper()} RESPONSE RULES:
# Add industry-specific rules here

üìã AVAILABLE AUDIO FILES:
{available_files}

Remember: Always be helpful, professional, and ready to assist customers!"""
```

### **Step 3: Update Availability Data**

#### **Custom Availability Slots:**
```python
# Update availability slots in config.py for your business schedule:
YOUR_BUSINESS_AVAILABILITY = {
    "available_slots": [
        {"date": "Monday, August 5th", "time": "9:00 AM - 11:00 AM", "slot_id": "MON05_0900"},

## üè¢ **EXAMPLE CLIENT CONFIGURATIONS**

### **Hotel Business**
```python
CLIENT_CONFIG = {
    "business_name": "Melbourne Grand Hotel",
    "ai_assistant_name": "Emma",
    "industry": "hotel",
    "location": "Australia",
    "city": "Melbourne",
    "phone_number": "+61XXXXXXXXX",
    "website": "https://melbournegrand.com.au",
    "business_hours": "24/7",
    "emergency_available": True,
    "service_area": "Melbourne CBD",
    "currency": "AUD",
    "timezone": "Australia/Melbourne"
}
```

### **Real Estate Business**
```python
CLIENT_CONFIG = {
    "business_name": "Brisbane Property Group",
    "ai_assistant_name": "Sarah",
    "industry": "real_estate",
    "location": "Australia",
    "city": "Brisbane",
    "phone_number": "+61XXXXXXXXX",
    "website": "https://brisbaneproperty.com.au",
    "business_hours": "Mon-Fri 9AM-5PM, Sat 9AM-3PM",
    "emergency_available": False,
    "service_area": "Greater Brisbane",
    "currency": "AUD",
    "timezone": "Australia/Brisbane"
}
```

### **Plumbing Business (Current)**
```python
CLIENT_CONFIG = {
    "business_name": "Pete's Plumbing",
    "ai_assistant_name": "Jason",
    "industry": "plumbing",
    "location": "Australia",
    "city": "Melbourne",
    "phone_number": "+61XXXXXXXXX",
    "website": "https://petesplumbing.com.au",
    "business_hours": "Mon-Fri 8AM-6PM, Sat 9AM-4PM",
    "emergency_available": True,
    "service_area": "Greater Melbourne",
    "currency": "AUD",
    "timezone": "Australia/Melbourne"
}
```

---

## üîß **PHASE 4: Route File Updates (15 minutes)**

### **Update Route Files:**

#### **File: routes/inbound.py**
```python
# Find line: selected_intro = "plumbing_intro.mp3"
# Change to: selected_intro = "your_new_intro_file.mp3"

# üîß Why this matters:
# - The route files tell the system which audio file to play first
# - If you don't update these, you'll get "audio not in cache" errors
# - This is the most commonly missed step when adapting for new clients
```

#### **File: routes/outbound.py**
```python
# Find line: selected_intro = "plumbing_intro.mp3"
# Change to: selected_intro = "your_new_intro_file.mp3"

# Same importance as inbound.py - must match your audio files
```

---

## üß™ **PHASE 5: Testing & Validation (30 minutes)**

### **Step 1: System Testing**
```bash
# 1. Start the system:
py main.py

# 2. Check system health:
# Visit: http://localhost:5000/debug/system_health

# 3. Verify audio files:
# Visit: http://localhost:5000/debug/audio_files

# 4. Test TTS generation:
# Visit: http://localhost:5000/test
```

### **Step 2: Call Testing**
```bash
# 1. Set up Twilio webhook:
# - Point to your server: https://your-domain.com/twilio/voice
# - Enable Media Streams for bidirectional audio

# 2. Test inbound calls:
# - Call your Twilio number
# - Verify intro plays correctly
# - Test conversation flow

# 3. Test outbound calls:
# - Use test endpoint: /call_test/your_number
# - Verify customer name personalization works
# - Test CSV campaign functionality
```

### **Step 3: Content Validation**
```bash
# 1. Verify all audio files play correctly
# 2. Check transcripts match audio content
# 3. Test booking functionality
# 4. Verify customer data collection
# 5. Check call logging and exports
```
